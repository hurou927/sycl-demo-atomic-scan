## Algorithm

1. Each thread-group calculates its group-id and global-thread-id dynamically using the atomic counter.
2. Each thread loads data at global-thread-id as an index and calculates local scan.
3. A worker thread in each thread-group calculates the global prefix-sum of partial sums.
4. Each thread calculates the global scan by the result of step-3 and writes it to the device memory.
